### Background

Healthcare is one of the most important social services that a country can provide to its citizens. By providing quality healthcare, a country keeps its citizens healthy, happy, and productive. Unfortunately, long wait times for walk-in clinics are one of the most frustrating problems in healthcare. MedMessage is designed to minimize the time a patient spends unnecessarily waiting for an appointment.

Our product accomplishes this by allowing patients to book appointment via SMS or web services. MedMessage provides a choice of nearby clinics to the client, giving them the flexibility of choice. After reviewing their choices, the patient can then choose a walk-in to book their appointment at. Afterwards, they can also review or cancel their appointment.

MedMessage frees time the time of patients that would have otherwise been spent in a waiting room, which reduces the stress on both the patients as well as the clinic staff. Additionally, patients are also more likely to book an appointment at a clinic if they donâ€™t have to wait in a waiting room, which prevents the conditions of patients from worsening.
